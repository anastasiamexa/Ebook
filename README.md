# Ebook
Bookstore Android application.

As part of the course "Current topics of software engineering - Software for mobile devices", I developed an android application called ebook.

## Features
- Users can create and log into their account, using Firebase Authentication.
- Displays all available books to the customers.
- View more information for each book and let the app read it to you, via Text to Speech (TTS).
- Search for a specific book via text or using the Speech to Text (STT) capability.
- Order books and pay for your purchase.

## Tech
For this application I used the Android Studio environment using Java. The database used is Firebase Realtime Database. In addition,
the Firebase Storage was used to store the images of the books.

## Documentation
The file [Documentation.pdf](https://github.com/anastasiamexa/Ebook/blob/main/Documentation.pdf) contains a detailed description of the methods used to create the application and a user manual (in Greek).

## Presentation
The file [demo.mp4](https://github.com/anastasiamexa/Ebook/blob/main/demo.mp4) is a short video demonstrating the usage and the functionality of the application.
